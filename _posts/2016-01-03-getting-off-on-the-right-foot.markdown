I'm really excited that I am starting off on a pretty good foot. I just subscribed to Audible through Amazon where I get a 3 month subscribtion for free. Each month you get a free audiobook (for the subscribtion price) and then you can buy more audiobooks as you need. The subscribtion price each month is $14.95. Therefore you are getting an audiobook for $14.95 a month. Each audiobook you get you get to keep for forever and listen to for forever.

I am a big fan of audiobooks, it's what introduced me to Harry Potter as well as got me into reading more when I was younger. So I'm a huge supporter and think that audiobooks are really great when you don't have an opportunity to sit down and read because you are always on the run. The best time is while I'm walking to work and I can listen on my walk over. Now what book to start off with.

When I get into reading books, I will prefer to read physical books. I am looking for book recommendations. Preferrably fiction or fantasy. Or something related to my career. I need to be better about my reading lists.

Anyway. I finally decided what my first audiobook will be: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Lightning Theif. I saw the movie first, so that might spoil it a bit for me, but I have been wanted to read the books. And I would like to get back into reading fantasy so I want to start off a bit easier.

Also, on a similar foot, I am considering that I keep 3 blogs (eventually and starting off slow). One will be this one, where I keep myself goal oriented and up-to-date on what my current goals are and how I have come to accomplish any of my goals. The next, which would have the same template as this but hosted through github because jekyll wouldn't allow me to try to have a second or third blog on here, but it would have all the same links, so it would be a pseduo fake blog on here because of the way github links your pages together (this is originally hosted through github, thank you, Github, for being awesome). This one would be about women in S.T.E.M. And the third would be set up in the similar fashion but about baking.

That last paragraph probably didn't make much sense but it's cool. It makes a lot of sense in my head.


UPDATE - 2016-01-03 21:34:00 - Figured out how to make a multiblog without having to build a second or third site through Github. (WHOO!) Apparently Google has all the answers for you. I am going to make mine a bit more simple honestly, or I might go with the suggestion because I think I figured out what my initial problem was. It will be brilliant and do awesome stuff. I will have to keep an eye on it and keep track of everything. I will especially need to work out how to make the RSS feed work correctly but all in due time.
