Essentially, I want to set some relatively realistic goals for myself which I will discuss in a later post. In the past year, I have accomplished so much. Let's review my past year:

Jan - I taught myself scss, explored Jekyll, and refactored my whole site in Jekyll.

Feb - I TAed my first GDI class. This was a really exciting experience, as I was able to help other students with something I am passionate about and something I had learned just 6 months prior.

Mar - I started interviewing for various positions. I was jobless and needed nearly anything that would help me proceed with my goal of becoming a Front End.

Apr - I started a contractor position with Curlate. This was going to only be temporary and it was slow to start but it was fun and I gained some relatively good experience.

May - I received and email from WebLinc if I would come in for a second interview with a team. I accepted and felt like I connected with the team well. I was thrilled that only days later I received an email saying I was accepted into the position of a Front End support at WebLinc.

Jun - On the first of June was my very first day at WebLinc. It was scary and crazy and I was thrown right into doing work but it was the best first day ever.

Jul - My second month at WebLinc, the very first week, I had to go to the hospital because of an infected tooth that I had to have surgery to remove. Needless to say, I stayed home during that week. To be fair, I didn't have much work to do yet because I was still relatively new. I also moved into a new house.

Aug - Nothing super eventful happened in August. Just kidding, nothing eventful happened in August workwise. But my nephew, Lucas, was born on my birthday. I guess that could be considered eventful. Towards the end of August, I decided to dye my hair pink, well at least parts of it.

Sep - Three months into my new job and I survived my three month review! It was relatively quiet for the rest of September.

Oct - Many eventful things happened in October. First, I helped launch my first site with WebLinc. I got to be a part of the team that launched the new [marika.com](http://www.marika.com)! My lead happened to also not be around the week we launched (entirely NOT her fault), so it was on my shoulders to make sure all the front end work was complete and any last minute changes or JS functionality that needed to be done was all on me (well not entirely, I had a whole company of people who were there to make sure I was on the right track). Also, my lead was lead on another team, that happened to launch in the same week, and so I semi took over helping with that, although not much had to be done on my part, it was just some minor tweaks and making sure that front end was all set (which is was).

In October, I was also asked to speak at the GDI 4 year anniversary party. Which was a great experience, because I got to let other women know that they too can find a job in Web Dev and that they are not alone. Finding the right support system and people in your life who will follow you on your journey is important and that being a part of GDI is a step in the right direction.

Nov - November started off will BarCamp Philly, where a friend asked myself and a bunch of other women to speak as part of a panel on making a transition into a career in web. A few coworkers were in the audience as well as people I had recently met who are looking for positions in the tech field. It was really great getting to share my experiences (yet again) and tell someone that they are not alone and that they can make a career in tech from something completely different. It's really one of those feel good moments and I had a few people come up to me and tell me that they've been inspired. Also, I received a shoutout on facebook from the wife of someone who recently graduated from NYCDA, saying that I have become a mentor to her and that I don't even know how much I inspired her. Well, that's exactly why I'm here, and why I am so passionate about what I do. I fight for the underdog and for the person who initially doesn't believe in themselves.

Also, in November, just before the holidays (this was a ~great~ time to do it), we launched a second [site](http://www.zobha.com) which is part of a multisite brand and a sister site to the first one we launched (see above).

Dec - Now December has come and gone. I mostly decorated cookies all December. Also, had loads of fun at the WebLinc Holiday Party and then joined in on the festivities on WebLinc Day the next day.

All in all, it was a really good year.
