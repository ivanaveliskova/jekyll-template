Alright, I will be perfectly honest, I am probably not the greatest web designer in the whole wide world. I'm still learning every single day something new and loving every moment of it because it allows me to continue to learn about the world, how it works, and how to incorporate that into my web designs.

Recently, I started looking at a lot of web pages to gain inspiration for a few projects I am currently working on. I tend to first look at how the page looks to get a sense of what they did, what I like about the design, what I don't like about the design, and to establish my own thoughts for a design. Next, I look at the source code if there are some interesting things I could use or learn from.
