  <h1 class="page__heading hidden">{{ site.title }}</h1>

  <h2 class="page__greeting">Hiya!</h2>

    <div class="img-right">
        <img src="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140301012104/mmandcharries/images/f/f2/Eevee.png" alt="Borrowed Image of Eevee from Wiki" title="Borrowed Image of Eevee from Wiki"/>
        <p class="img-subtext">Looks just like me!</p>
    </div>

    <p>My name is Ivana. That’s Ivana, spelled I-V-A-N-A, but the “I” is pronounced like the Ee in Eevee. Sometimes I go by Ivanka. (Yeah, I know, like Donald Trump's daughter, but the thing is, for me it is a nickname and not my actual name.)</p>

    <p>I have an incredibly expensive, gold-embossed paperweight from Boston University in World Peace, or as some like to call it: International Relations. Instead, I chose a path relating to my chosen major ~very~ well: front end web developer.</p>

    <p>I am mostly self taught in web development with supplemental classes taken through <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a> to augment what I had taught myself. In case you're not familiar with it, GDI is an incredible springboard for women trying to break into the technological industry. They have a very welcoming environment (men can take classes too!) where you can ask the important questions like, &ldquo;What’s an ID?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why is my code not working? Oh, I forgot a parenthesis&#8230;&rdquo; (these may or may not be actual events) in a safe and supportive environment without feeling like anyone is judging or rolling their eyes at you.</p>

    <p>When I’m not busy trying to figure out how to turn on my computer (kidding&#8230; maybe), I love to bake and occasionally do a little dance. I like to pretend that I’m a decent photographer (although the 400 selfies I have to take before I post just 1 would say otherwise&#8230; Earlybird, anyone?).</p>

    <p>But something most people probably don’t know about me? I AM A NERD AND PROUD OF IT.</p>

    <p>I love Harry Potter, and almost anything by the BBC (<a href="https://twitter.com/ivanaveliskova/status/543810284297920513">Doctor Who</a>, Sherlock, The Musketeers, Merlin, etc.) I am a Pokemon Master (see proof <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanaveliskova/status/478689722005725185">here</a>) I am wildly competitive in any tabletop game, including (but not limited to) <a href="http://instagram.com/p/r55V7pCUPZ/">Settlers of Catan</a>, Takenoko, Munchkin (Adventure Time version), Race for the Galaxy, 7 Wonders, and more (I spend a lot of time watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT954wz47aofSlvu0zbD4YuPOF">Wil Wheaton on Tabletop</a>). I also watch more anime (SAO, Sailormoon, and Fairy Tail, to name a few) than I care to admit. I can solve a Rubik’s cube and drive a manual transmission (though not at the same time&#8230; safety first!). Oh, and secretly, I know I’m a ninja. </p>
