# jekyll-template

The beginnings of a brand new and modern template using jekyll! :-D

Right now it is being developed as identical as possible to the originally provided jekyll template when you first create a new site, but using flexbox instead of the bootstrapy columns and floats. Because no one likes float... or weird columns. But flexbox is amazing.

Ok, so I have moved on from the Jekyll base code and have started veering into my own stuff. Still using flexbox for some interesting concepts, but also adding some more areas for customization. Right now, it is kind of gearing towards me and my needs for a website, but soon I hope to change it to a more generic template that can be forked and used and stuff. *BOOM* ~Micdrop~
