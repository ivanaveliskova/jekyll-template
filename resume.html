                    I have taken various classes with Girl Develop It, including Intro to HTML/CSS, Intro to Javascript/jQuery, Intro to Ruby. And have, in a sense, retaken a lot of the classes as a TA, where I get to help other students learn and sometimes I end up learning something myself.

                    I am a front end developer. I build websites for e-commerce companies. See some projects that I have worked on <a href="/developer">here</a>. I build custom javascript functions and implement various designs as per requested by our clients. I work mostly in Haml, Scss, and javascript/jQuery/underscore.js, but I occsionally dabble in the Ruby on Rails side of things and work alongside different teams and for different clients.

                    I started off as a Girl Develop It student and moved on up to being a teaching assistant for various classes such as Intro to HTML and CSS, Intro to Javascript, and Intro to jQuery. I continue to TA and am also now teaching classes, such as Intro to jQuery. I am also helping develop their curriculum by creating new classes to help further what is taught and help prepare women (and some men) who wish to change careers to have the skills and experience needed to enter a new career in technology.

                    As a part time contractor, I worked on Curalate's Fan Reel product for several clients. I used HTML and CSS to edit the look as per designs and made certain <a href="/blogger/developing-for-IE8">development choices</a> to accomodate various designs.
