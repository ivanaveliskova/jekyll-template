Herrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has been forever and a day since I came here to update the world on my whereabouts.

I am here now!

Since my last post, back in May or so, I have done so many things:

- For about 2 months, I was contracting as a front end developer, which was really exciting to get to work on websites and then actually see the work I did appear online in real places.

- Now I am a full time Front End Web Developer at a little company called WebLinc. Ok, they aren't so little. They are an e-commerce company and they are awesome as sauce. (See what I did there?)

I get to work on building the whole website alongside a team of really smart people. It's quite awesome. ("Everything is awesome! Everything is cool when you're part of a team!") I have been there for almost 2 months now and I really enjoy the work I do. Every day it is something different whether I'm working on a new part of the site or maintaining other clients' sites. Also, everyone is super nice.

I'd also like to direct your attention to an article I recently [read][article] which I found super fascinating.

And that is it for now! I shall hopefully return with updates in the future about new and exciting things that I learn!
