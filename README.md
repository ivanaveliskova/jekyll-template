# jekyll-template

The beginnings of a brand new and modern template using jekyll! :-D

Right now it is being developed as identical as possible to the originally provided jekyll template when you first create a new site, but using flexbox instead of the bootstrapy columns and floats. Because no one likes float... or weird columns. But flexbox is amazing.
